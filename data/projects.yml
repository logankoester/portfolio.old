    description: |
      From idea to prototype to full launch, I worked with CarZen as a partner, helping them develop a cutting edge website. By building an extensible restful API we were able to easily integrate a complex backend algorithm with a beautiful user-friendly Flash based interface designed by Intersect and Unity Theory. The jQuery javascript framework was also used to elevate the XHTML sections of the site to the level of thier Flash counterparts.
